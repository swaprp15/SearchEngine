ToDo

PHASE II

1. Limit resut to 10
2. Apply ranking to posting list itself to reduce size of index
3. Count total number of documents
4. Decide optimal no of docs after which we need to write map to file 
5. Stop searching the posting list as soon as we find 10 results. (For this we can sort posting list based on the tf-idf and keep limited entries.. For non field queries we can just take first 10 results and for other field queries we can just scan linearly untill we find 10 results.)


PHASE I

Persistent SecondLevel 

Use String Builder  -  Instead of char array... (to avoid overflow) ********** IMP **************

*****************  IMP *****  delte intermediate index files

Use long I guess.. for IDs

Exception handling

2nd Level index... ********** Persist it **********..

Improve parsing...

Free up memory used by TreeSet Map etc.

Adjust no of docs to be persisted to file to optimal...

make sure we KEEP Stop WORDS file and those words indeed get added....
TreeSet to HashSet..
